# Mc-Chat (Temp Name)

### About
This is a small python client to send and recieve chat messages on a
minecraft server without having to log into it.  I got sick of loading
up my modded Minecraft instance to send a quick message to my friends.
  

### Dependencies
The only requirement for this program is the Requests library which can be gotten with the command  
```
pip install requests
```
  
If you don't have pip, installation information can be found [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
